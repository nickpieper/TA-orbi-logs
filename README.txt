This is an add-on powered by the Splunk Add-on Builder.

This TA takes your Orbi logs and extracts fields within Splunk that are mapped to CIM compliant fields.

This TA requires that you have the Orbi-Logger app running on a server, with a Splunk forwarder monitoring that file.

Once you have that up and running, place the TA on your Splunk instance and enjoy!
